# RightOne Speed Dating Web app
Python Django for Social Network

The system was implemented using Django Web Tool and we chose SQLite as the database management tool.

Follow- ing functions in our demo: 
* user log in & out, users’ profile editing and management, searching the database with multiple queries, sending friend request and in-mail, display of a list of friends on users’ profile.
* Users are supposed to be able to sign up with their existing Google, Facebook, Github or Twitter account.
After logging in, they would be allowed to create and edit the profile. 

The friend searching function would be sharding based on users’ specific preference 
such as sex, hobbies (music or movie type, sports), age, location, education background, 
career etc. Once they got a list of users’ name that satisfied all the conditions, 
they could view these profiles and decide whether to send the friend request or just follow them.
They even could send in-mails to introduce themselves and thus increase the possibility 
that their friend request to be accepted.
